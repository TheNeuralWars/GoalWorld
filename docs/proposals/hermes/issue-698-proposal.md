## Objective
English localization of webapp UI - campaign is English but webapp is fully Spanish.

## Scope
1. Wire goalworld_webapp to consume existing i18n_reference.js from docs/assets/js/i18n.js (has complete en block at line 507)
2. Add EN | ES toggle to App.tsx persisted in localStorage
3. Ship English version first (active campaign language)

- All Spanish strings in NFTMarketplace.tsx, DashboardGrid.tsx, DashboardHub.tsx, AICoach.tsx, AICommentator.tsx, ClassicHub.tsx, ClubPortal.tsx, CreateUser.tsx, EstadioPortal.tsx, SwarmVaults.tsx replaced with i18n
- EN/ES toggle in App.tsx persisted in localStorage
