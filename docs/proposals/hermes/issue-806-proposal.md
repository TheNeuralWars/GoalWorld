## Objective
Create a new test file to demonstrate basic file creation and read capabilities within the goalworld project structure, fulfilling the "Untitled Task" requirement for issue #806.

## Proposed file list
- `/data/apps/goalworld/hermes_tests/hello_hermes.txt`

## Risks/regressions + rollback
### Risks
- **File creation failure:** The `write_file` operation might fail due to insufficient permissions or unexpected filesystem issues. This would be reported by the tool.
- **Directory creation failure:** The parent directory `hermes_tests` might not be created automatically by `write_file` (though it typically does). If so, a separate `mkdir` step would be needed.

### Regressions
- No regressions are expected as this task involves creating a new, isolated test file and directory that does not interfere with existing project code or assets.

### Rollback
- To revert the changes, delete the created file and its parent directory:
  ```bash
  rm -f /data/apps/goalworld/hermes_tests/hello_hermes.txt
  rmdir /data/apps/goalworld/hermes_tests
  ```

## Exact test commands
1. **Create the directory and file:**
   ```python
   print(default_api.write_file(path='/data/apps/goalworld/hermes_tests/hello_hermes.txt', content='Hello, Hermes! This is issue #806.'))
   ```
2. **Verify file existence and content:**
   ```python
   print(default_api.read_file(path='/data/apps/goalworld/hermes_tests/hello_hermes.txt'))
   ```
3. **Clean up (optional rollback verification):**
   ```bash
   rm -f /data/apps/goalworld/hermes_tests/hello_hermes.txt
   rmdir /data/apps/goalworld/hermes_tests
   ```
