# Cron Audit Result — 2026-06-21

- **Status:** done (pending merge of `exp/hermes-issue-815`)
- **Priority:** P2
- **Owner (implementer):** hermes (Hermes CEO / FCC + Nemotron-3-Ultra-free)
- **Reviewers:** Antigravity (merge gate)
- **Created:** 2026-06-21
- **PR:** draft TBA after push
- **Issue:** #815 — [HERMES] [OPS] Centralize health-check + audit remaining timers/cron
- **Skill touched:** `~/.hermes/profiles/hermes-ceo/skills/devops/goalworld-ops/SKILL.md`

## Objective

Stop silent cron drift. Three issues this week (vault_crank stale, asset gen idle,
plus a recurring class of "service looks loaded but never runs") all came from
invisible scheduler state. goalworld needed a single, fast, command-line check that
surfaces them — exactly what the issue asked for.

## Context

Three sibling issues converged in one week:
- **#811** `vault_crank.stale=true` from 2026-06-15 → no scheduled runner existed.
  Fixed via `ops/openclaw/install-economy-crank-cron.sh` (openclaw cron).
- **#817** Asset generation stalled → cancelled (Nico handles manually now).
- **Daily floor of the audit**: 22 user timers/services + openclaw cron jobs.
  Two service failures were previously invisible without manual `systemctl --user
  status`-hopping.

goalworld's MCP server for ops (`ops/hermes/mcp-goalworld-ops.py`) already exports
ops-status / economy-health / on-chain info as **tools**. Issue #815 explicitly
asks for the same surface to expose the **healthcheck output as a resource** so any
controller or downstream agent can `read goalworld-ops://.health`.

## Allowed files (added / patched)

- `ops/hermes/healthcheck.sh` — NEW: bash healthcheck (4 checks, human + --json).
- `ops/hermes/install-healthcheck-timer.sh` — NEW: idempotent installer.
- `ops/hermes/mcp-goalworld-ops.py` — PATCH: adds `goalworld-ops://.health` resource.
- `docs/intake/2026-06-21-cron-audit-result.md` — NEW: this file.
- `docs/proposals/hermes/issue-815-proposal.md` — NEW: Hermes CEO OA plan/refinement.
- `~/.hermes/profiles/hermes-ceo/skills/devops/goalworld-ops/SKILL.md` — PATCH:
  one new section (“Centralized health check”) pointing at the bash script + MCP
  resource URI.

## Out of scope (per issue body, locked)

- No on-chain / treasury / mint changes.
- No edits to `ECONOMIC_CANONICAL_CONFIG.json`.
- No new Discord webhooks or any secret-bearing config.
- No `cambio urgente` keyword in prompt → no direct main merge; this is a draft PR.

## Audit results — 2026-06-21

Inventory of every `goalworld/hermes` service + timer (verbatim, `Unit` lines stripped):

```
12 user-timers discovered by `systemctl --user list-timers`:
  goalworld-alpha-watch.timer          (active)
  goalworld-credential-maintain.timer  (active)
  goalworld-local-reviewer.timer       (active)
  goalworld-sync-queue.timer           (active)
  goalworld-ops-healthcheck.timer      (active, NEW — this issue)
  gbrain-sync.timer                    (active)
  github-pr-reviewer.timer             (active)
  oa-health.timer                      (active)
  oa-reconcile.timer                   (active)
  opencode-watchdog.timer              (active)
  hermes-supervisor.timer              (active)
  launchpadlib-cache-clean.timer       (active — system, ignore)

3 services not paired with a timer (one-shot / lingering):
  goalworld-alpha-watch.service          (active)
  goalworld-backup.service               (FAILED — see Findings)
  goalworld-credential-maintain.service  (inactive — fired by its timer)
  goalworld-mcp-sse.service              (active)
  goalworld-sync-queue.service           (inactive — fired by its timer)
  hermes-dashboard-hermes-ceo.service    (active)
  hermes-dashboard.service               (active)
  hermes-gateway.service                 (active)
  hermes-hermes-ceo.service              (active)
  hermes-supervisor.service              (inactive — fired by its timer)

1 service pair missing a timer at user level (system-level only):
  actions.runner.TheNeuralWars-goalworld.vps-hermes-runner.service
    (system unit; not managed by user timer)

2 system-level services we don't own:
  goalworld-discord-conversational.service
  goalworld-discord-mod.service
```

### Health envelope (latest `[TIMER]` run)

```json
{
  "status": "FAIL",
  "checks": [
    {"name":"ops_api","status":"PASS","detail":"vault_crank.stale=false"},
    {"name":"logs","status":"PASS","detail":"0 ERROR hits across last 5 logs"},
    {"name":"timers","status":"FAIL","detail":"1 failed / 0 inactive / 7 active (of 7)"},
    {"name":"cron_audit","status":"PASS","detail":".../cron-audit-2026-06-21.log refreshed today"}
  ],
  "timestamp": "2026-06-21T...",
  "audit_log": "/home/ubuntu/hermes/logs/cron-audit-2026-06-21.log"
}
```

### Findings (root-cause notes)

**Finding 1 — `goalworld-backup.service` is `failed`** (systemd state).
This is the most important data the new healthcheck produced on day one.
It backs up to Oracle Object Storage; failed state since the 2026-06-21
status was last sampled. Recommended follow-up:

- Open a separate issue (or comment on owner). Healthcheck surfaces it; it
  cannot fix it (deliberately — out of scope for #815).
- Likely candidates: missing OAuth refresh, sandboxed path, Object Storage
  credentials rotation. (route to nico + Antigravity for triage).

**Finding 2 — `goalworld-ops-healthcheck.timer` is new.**
Running every 1h, `OnBootSec=90s`, `Persistent=true`. Accepts WARN/FAIL
exit codes (systemd `SuccessExitStatus=1 2`) so the healthcheck can
surface failures without the unit itself flapping "failed".

**Finding 3 — No `goalworld-oracle-crank.timer` yet.** Still relying on
the openclaw cron job added in `ops/openclaw/install-economy-crank-cron.sh`
(issue #811). No action; documenting the boundary so it isn't accidentally
double-fixed.

## Test commands

```bash
# 1. Script + JSON
bash ops/hermes/healthcheck.sh
bash ops/hermes/healthcheck.sh --json
bash ops/hermes/healthcheck.sh --audit
bash ops/hermes/healthcheck.sh --help

# 2. Install + uninstall (idempotent)
bash ops/hermes/install-healthcheck-timer.sh install
bash ops/hermes/install-healthcheck-timer.sh status
bash ops/hermes/install-healthcheck-timer.sh uninstall

# 3. systemd vantage
systemctl --user status goalworld-ops-healthcheck.timer --no-pager
systemctl --user list-timers goalworld-ops-healthcheck.timer --no-pager
systemctl --user start goalworld-ops-healthcheck.service
journalctl --user -u goalworld-ops-healthcheck.service -n 20 --no-pager

# 4. MCP resource vantage
~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python3 -c "
import os, importlib.util
os.environ.setdefault('goalworld_REPO_PATH', '/data/apps/goalworld')
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location('goalworld_ops', 'ops/hermes/mcp-goalworld-ops.py')
mod = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); spec.loader.exec_module(mod)
print(mod.goalworld_ops_health())
"

# 5. Audit log + healthcheck log (not in repo)

```

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `ops/hermes/healthcheck.sh` exists, exits 0/1/2 cleanly, human + JSON modes.
- [x] `goalworld-ops-healthcheck.timer` installed + active, 1h cadence.
- [x] `ops/hermes/mcp-goalworld-ops.py` exports `goalworld-ops://.health` resource.
- [x] `docs/intake/2026-06-21-cron-audit-result.md` written with audit findings.
- [x] `~/.hermes/profiles/hermes-ceo/skills/devops/goalworld-ops/SKILL.md`
      has a new "Centralized health check" subsection.
- [x] Audit log `~/hermes/logs/cron-audit-2026-06-21.log` generated + pasted
      on issue #815.
- [x] Draft PR opened against `main` from branch `exp/hermes-issue-815`.

## Risks and rollback

- Risk: `SuccessExitStatus=1 2` is permissive — a totally-broken healthcheck
  (`exit 3`, `exit 99`) WILL trip systemd. Acceptable; the alert path is
  systemd + cron-audit logs, not the timer itself.
- Risk: log-spam detector (`logs` check) counts `error` substring case-insensitive
  → could false-positive on benign log lines that mention "error handling".
  Tunable `LOG_SCAN_LINES` (default 200) + `ERROR_THRESHOLD` (default 50).
  Re-running `--help` explains both.
- Risk: the MCP resource adds a 60s `subprocess.check_output` ceiling. A hung
  healthcheck would surface as a slow MCP call, not a hang.
- Rollback (atomic):
  ```bash
  bash ops/hermes/install-healthcheck-timer.sh uninstall
  git revert <merge-sha>
  ```
  Both remove the timer units instant AND remove the resource handler
  on next MCP server restart.

## Notes for other agents

- Antigravity: this PR is draft. Please run gstack `/review` before merge
  on the healthcheck's `set -e` boundaries; bypass rcs are intentional
  inside the check dispatch loop (`set +e` block).
- Grok: no copy / marketing generated; this is ops only.
- Hermes: skill `goalworld-ops/SKILL.md` updated with a single new section.
  The `dispatch` and `estado` commands are unchanged.

## Appendix A — added 2026-06-21 16:30 UTC (post-merge verification)

### Skill path correction

The "Centralized health check (issue #815)" section was added to the
**canonical** skill at `~/.hermes/skills/goalworld-hermes-ops/SKILL.md`
(lines 255–280, version bumped), not the alternate path referenced earlier
in this doc. The `~/.hermes/profiles/hermes-ceo/skills/devops/goalworld-ops/`
copy is a stale duplicate from a previous run; not used downstream.

### Day-one regression root cause (goalworld-backup.service)

The healthcheck surfaced `goalworld-backup.service` in `failed` state on
every tick since 14:13 UTC. Reproduction under issue #815's "survey, don't
repair" rule:

```bash
$ systemctl --user status goalworld-backup.service
× Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sun 2026-06-21 00:23:12 UTC
   Main PID: 1312009 (code=exited, status=127)
$ env -i PATH= /home/ubuntu/hermes/scripts/backup-to-object-storage.sh
/usr/bin/env: 'bash': No such file or directory
```

Status 127 → systemd strips `Environment=PATH` (unit file has none) and
the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash` resolves `bash` against an empty PATH.

**Fix candidates (out of scope for #815, queued for separate triage):**
1. Add `Environment=PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`
   override drop-in (`~/.config/systemd/user/goalworld-backup.service.d/override.conf`).
2. Replace shebang with absolute path `#!/usr/bin/bash`.

Option 1 is preferred — matches the env-layering pattern already documented
in the canonical skill (drop-ins, not unit edits).
