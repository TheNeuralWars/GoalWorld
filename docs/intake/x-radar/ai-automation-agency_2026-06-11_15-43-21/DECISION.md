# Go/No-Go Decision: ai-automation-agency

## Recommendation
[x] **QUEUE** — Next Sprint (Score 36-47) — Build Immediately (Score ≥ 48)
- [x] **QUEUE** — Next Sprint (Score 36-47)
- [ ] **PARK** — Revisit Later (Score 24-35)
- [ ] **REFERENCE** — Learn Only (Score 12-23)
- [ ] **DISCARD** — No Fit (Score < 12)

## Score: 41/60

## Score: 41/60

## Rationale
**Validated model (Voxly 53/60 → $72K ARR in 3 months)** with clear path to revenue. However, **lower infra synergy (7/10)** because base stack differs (Supabase/Vercel/Next.js vs our Hermes/goalworld), and **competitive market** (many "AI content" startups). Our unique moat is **goalworld sports/crypto native data + on-chain verification** — something no competitor has.

Best approach: **Build as goalworld product extension** — reuse webapp, SDK, on-chain program; add voice engine + multi-platform delivery. This transforms a generic "AI content SaaS" into a **vertical-specific platform with proprietary data**.

## Next Actions
1. **Week 1-2:** FCC builds Core Voice Engine (P0, 20h, tier opus)
2. **Week 2-3:** FCC builds goalworld Sports Data Plugin + On-chain Verification (P0, 32h)
3. **Week 2:** Deploy live demo on Supabase/Vercel free tiers (Manager, 16h)
4. **Week 1:** Nico starts outreach to 25 contacts (5 verticals × 5 each)
5. **Week 4:** First B2B demo → close Client 1
6. **Week 8:** 3 B2B signed = $6K MRR

## Blocker Check
- [ ] goalworld merge stack (#32-#34) on main? (needed for on-chain verification)
- [x] FCC capacity available? (opus for voice engine, sonnet for rest)
- [ ] Demo infra ready? (Supabase/Vercel free tiers + Hetzner demo node)
- [ ] Stripe account for B2B subscriptions? (Nico to confirm)
- [ ] Legal entity for contracts? (Nico to confirm)
- [ ] X history export for Nico voice clone demo? (or API access)
