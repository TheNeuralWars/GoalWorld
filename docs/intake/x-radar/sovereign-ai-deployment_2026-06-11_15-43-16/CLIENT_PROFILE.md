# Client Profile: sovereign-ai-deployment

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary Vertical: Regulated Financial Services (LatAm + EU)
- **Vertical:** Banks, Fintechs, Payment processors, Crypto exchanges (MiCA/ARG regulation)
- **Size:** 100-5000 employees
- **Pain Point:** Data residency laws (BCRA, GDPR, MiCA), audit requirements, cannot use cloud AI APIs, need air-gapped or on-prem inference

- **Decision Maker:** CISO / CTO / Head of AI + Compliance Officer

### Secondary Verticals
1. **Healthcare / Healthtech** — HIPAA/Ley 26.529, patient data never leaves, clinical notes processing
2. **Government / Defense** — Classified data, air-gapped, sovereign cloud requirements
3. **Legal / Compliance Firms** — Attorney-client privilege, cross-border data transfer bans
4. **Industrial / OT** — Factory floor, no internet, predictive maintenance on-prem
