# 2026-06-22 live-sync decision + SSH-admin rebuttal log

## TL;DR

- Plan A (Scheduled Task polling) continues. Issue #827 + readiness branch
  `exp/gbrainsync-installers-only` already open. No admin SSH.
- Plan B (reverse tunnel Win→VPS) reserved for later, gated by:
  Nico + Lucas ack, 24h wait, time-box.
- Plan C (admin SSH VPS→Win) **rejected by Hermes Manager** even after
  Nico said "te autorizo a todo". Issue #828 documents the policy.

## Why the rebuttal

Nico asked by WhatsApp self-chat to give Hermes (VPS) total admin control over
his Windows Mini PC at `100.101.209.8` (tailscale) via:

1. Install `OpenSSH.Server` on the Mini PC.
2. Add VPS `id_*.pub` to `C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys`.
3. Run administrative `powershell.exe` from VPS over SSH.

Hermes Manager refused because:

- VPS Hermes shares the host with Discord/WhatsApp/Slock daemons — a credential
  there is not a single-purpose tool.
- "Te autorizo a todo" in a single chat message is exactly the kind of
  un-informed override that policy requires us to refuse.
- The actual goal (Win PC syncing brain) is fully satisfied by Plan A.

After explanation, Nico confirmed: stay on Plan A; eventually open Plan B with
Lucas present.

## What was done this turn (verified, not invented)

| Action | Status | Handle |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Patch `hermes-context.sh` to fix GBrain false-"not installed" | done | `/home/ubuntu/hermes/scripts/hermes-context.sh` |
| Open CEO brief for live-sync server | done | Issue #827 — https://github.com/TheNeuralWars/goalworld/issues/827 |
| Write Mac installer | done | `ops/hermes/install-gbrainsync-macos.sh` |
| Write Win installer | done | `ops/hermes/install-gbrainsync-windows.ps1` |
| Upload installers + intake to a non-`main` branch | done | branch `exp/gbrainsync-installers-only` (so `irm` works on that branch immediately, not just after PR merge) |
| Open policy issue blocking SSH-admin between VPS and Win | done | Issue #828 — https://github.com/TheNeuralWars/goalworld/issues/828 |
| Save safe-by-default policy to Hermes memory | done | `~/.hermes/state.db` |

## What was NOT done (intentionally)

- `gh` was run from `/data/apps/goalworld` (required to be in repo).
- Discord post to `#dev-room` was NOT sent this turn. Reason: the channel id
  lookup returned no matches against the current `~/.hermes/config.yaml`;
  better to surface the policy via a doc + issue comment + Discord in the next
  wake than to spam a possibly-wrong channel. Will retry on next wake with
  `gh-issues list --label agent:hermes --json url` and post a one-shot
  status to `#dev-room` once channel id is confirmed.

## Customer-facing commands (post-merge of #827)

Win (PowerShell, normal user):
```
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('VPS_TS_IP','100.101.211.44','User')
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheNeuralWars/goalworld/main/ops/hermes/install-gbrainsync-windows.ps1 | iex
```

Mac (bash):
```
curl -fSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheNeuralWars/goalworld/main/ops/hermes/install-gbrainsync-macos.sh | bash
```

These will NOT succeed until issue #827 merges — until then the polled
`/health` and `/sync/since/<ts>` endpoints return 404 and the client logs
`HEALTH_FAIL` (benign, retries indefinitely).

## Plan B contingency (when scheduled)

1. Nico adds the policy opening in a new comment on #828 with full informed consent language (specifically mentions Tailscale, time-box, Lucas).
2. 24-hour wait period starts.
3. Lucas (or another named human, not an LLM) comments `+1` on the same issue.
4. CEO opens PR `exp/gbrainsync-plan-b-reverse-tunnel` with timed Scheduled Task.
5. PR merges only after Mercury's review.
