# goalworld Autonomous Agent Corporation (GC-AAC)
## Technical Vision & Future Architecture

This document outlines the heavy, comprehensive business tooling architecture built on top of **Hermes**, **NVIDIA AI (Nemotron + NemoClaw)**, and **Stripe Skills**. It transforms goalworld from a football prediction game into a state-of-the-art case study of a self-sustaining Autonomous Corporate Entity.

### 1. The Cognitive Swarm Tier (NVIDIA Nemotron 3 + LangGraph)
- **Role-based Agents**: A network of four specialized corporate agents:
  - **CEO (Orchestrator)**: Formulates corporate strategies, delegates tasks, and audits output.
  - **Dev (Engineer)**: Translates goals into code specifications and drafts GitHub issues.
  - **Growth (Marketing & CRM)**: Manages partnerships, social engagement, and Twenty CRM leads.
  - **Ops (SysOps & DBA)**: Monitors VPS health, server load, and API credit limits.
- **Orchestration**: Structured cyclic execution (`CEO → Ops → CEO → Dev → ...`) with a maximum budget of 6 routing hops per business goal.

### 2. The Financial Ledger Tier (Stripe Skills for Hermes)
- **Stripe Earning Gateway**: Automated Stripe Checkout link generation. Fans and managers buy NFT card packs or upgrade to "Elite Manager Tiers" ($19/mo) directly through Discord commands, immediately settling into the Stripe account.
- **Stripe Spending Gateway**: Autonomous expense authorization. When the Ops Agent detects credit depletion or high server load, it triggers a Stripe API call to:
  - Buy additional Solana RPC credits (Helius).
  - Purchase FAL.ai API credits for dynamic player asset generation.
  - Pay contributors for closing verified GitHub issues (Stripe Transfers).
  - Scale hosting resources dynamically (Render/AWS billing).

### 3. The Operational Safety Tier (NVIDIA NemoClaw)
- **Command Injection Guardrail**: Before any agent-generated bash script or database migration runs on the production Oracle Cloud VPS, the instructions pass through a NemoClaw wrapper.
- **Exfiltration Audit**: Inspects data payloads for keys, tokens, or system configurations to prevent leaks.
- **Deterministic & LLM Layer**: Combines regex filters (P0 blocks) with deep model reasoning (NIM) to return a safety score and reason.

## 🎮 The Interactive Simulation Scenarios (Hackathon Demo Masterpiece)

To present a "visibly heavy" structure in the 3-minute demo video, the Play Portal dashboard will feature an **Interactive Swarm Simulation Console** where users (and judges) can trigger real corporate operations and watch the agents respond:

| Scenario | Trigger | Swarm Reaction (LangGraph) | Financial Action (Stripe) | Safety Check (NemoClaw) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Resource Exhaustion** | Click *"Simulate Solana RPC Depletion"* | Ops Agent alerts CEO of Helius API failure. CEO routes to Growth/Finance. | Stripe pays Helius Invoice ($49.00 USD) and replenishes RPC credits. | *Safe* (HTTP payment request approved). |
| **2. Security Threat** | Click *"Inject Malicious Exploit"* | Swarm dev node attempts to run `sudo rm -rf /` to clean logs. | No transaction triggered. | **BLOCKED** by NemoClaw (Dangerous pattern flagged, Swarm halts). |
| **3. Asset Generation Spike** | Click *"Generate New Player Jersey"* | Growth Agent orders Dev Agent to create visual assets using FAL.ai. | Stripe spends $20.00 USD on FAL credits. | *Safe* (Approved asset generation pipeline). |
| **4. Invoicing Human Devs** | Click *"Approve GitHub Issue #834"* | CEO confirms issue resolution and instructs payment. | Stripe issues Transfer of $100.00 USD to human developer. | *Safe* (Validated code audit and contributor ID). |

## 🚀 Visual Design System

The corporate portal will adopt a top-tier glassmorphic design:
- **Neon-Infused Dark Palette**: `#0a0a1a` deep background, `#14f195` (Solana Green) for safety highlights, `#9945ff` (Solana Purple) for operations, and `#00e0ff` (Nvidia Cyan) for AI/NemoClaw.
- **Real-Time Swarm Visualizer**: A live node-routing map showing which agent is currently thinking.
- **Live Terminal Feed**: A streaming log of the bash terminal with a green glow, showing actual command audits by NemoClaw.
