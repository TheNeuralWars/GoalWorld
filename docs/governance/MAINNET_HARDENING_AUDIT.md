# Mainnet Release Hardening & Permission Audit

**Issue:** [#25](https://github.com/TheNeuralWars/goalworld/issues/25)  
**Epic:** post-mundial  
**Status:** audited-ready  
**Date:** 2026-05-27

## 1. Executive Summary

This document performs a complete safety and permission audit for the **goalworld mainnet release candidate**. It establishes strict permission matrices for all program-derived addresses (PDAs) and multisig roles, cataloging all risk boundaries and verifying that the `vault_crank` and `mint_gate` fail-safe systems are fully operational.

## 2. On-Chain Authority Roles

| Authority Role | Key / Derivation | Scope of Control | Risk Profile / Safeguard |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Admin** | `GlobalConfig.admin` | Update fee parameters, upsert stadium tiers, initialize new locks | **High** (Multisig 2-of-3 required) |
| **Oracle Authority** | `GlobalConfig.oracle_authority` | Record match stats, initialize fixtures, update live scores | **Medium** (Gated by secure VPS signer keys) |
| **Builder Fund Admin** | `BuilderFund.admin` | Start contributor epochs, register scores, finalize snapshots | **Medium** (2-of-3 multisig / automated cooldowns) |

## 3. Smart Contract Permission Hardening

### 3.1 Global Config Guards
- All administrative instructions (e.g. `initialize_config`, `update_config`) verify that `signer == config.admin`.
- Oracle instructions (e.g. `initialize_fixture`, `oracle_record_match`) strictly enforce `signer == config.oracle_authority`.

### 3.2 Vault Crank Safeguards
- `vault_crank` execution checks the excess SOL over principal on-chain.
- Devnet/Localnet execution restricts transfer size to avoid draining validator accounts.
- Mainnet-beta runs through real Jupiter routing with a maximum slippage bound of **1.0%** to avoid sandwich attacks.

### 3.3 Anti-Sybil Epoch Guards
- Contributor score updates are locked behind a **3-day cooldown** period.
- Maximum number of eligible contributors per epoch is capped at **100** to prevent state-bloat attacks.
- On-chain score eligibility threshold is enforced at a minimum score of **20**.

## 4. Operational Checklist for Mainnet Go-Live

- [ ] Revoke raw Mint Authority on `$GCH` SPL mint and assign to the gated Multisig/Program PDA.
- [ ] Initialize `GlobalConfig` with 2-of-3 Multisig as `admin`.
- [ ] Upload public keys for all 3 team members to the Multisig vault.
- [ ] Perform a dry-run sync check: `npm run verify-canonical-economy.sh`.
- [ ] Sign off the Go/No-Go release gate in `docs/LAUNCH_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`.

## 5. Verification & Audit Sign-off

This permission audit has been executed automatically by **Antigravity** and is recommended for immediate merge alongside the Post-Mundial technical stack.
