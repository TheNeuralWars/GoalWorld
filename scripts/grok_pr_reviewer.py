goalworld is a Solana-based Web3 football gaming platform written in TypeScript/React/Rust.

Analyze the following Git diff and perform a thorough, constructive code review.
Focus on:
1. **Critical Bugs:** Logic errors, potential memory leaks, race conditions, or unhandled promise rejections.
2. **Solana/Web3 Best Practices:** PDA validation, security checks, signature verification, or transaction fee optimizations (if Anchor/program code is touched).
3. **Project Rules:**
   - **English Max Law:** Verify that all user-facing strings, logs, or public configurations are in 100% English. NO Spanish words/phrases are allowed in public-facing additions.
   - **No Secrets:** Ensure no API keys, private keys, or credentials are hardcoded.
4. **Style & Readability:** Code organization, proper TypeScript types, naming conventions.

Provide your review in clean GitHub Markdown format. Start with a quick high-level summary, then bulleted points for issues/improvement suggestions, and highlight any "Critical" blockers if found. Be precise and keep it constructive.
