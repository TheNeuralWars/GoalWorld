story_arc.py — Hermes Story-Arc Planner

Assigns each run to a Story Arc (a multi-episode narrative thread per account)
so audiences see continuity across posts instead of disconnected one-offs.
Becomes especially valuable at 5k+ followers where subscribers start
recognising series.

State:    arc_state.json in /data/marketing_pipeline/. Lightweight, atomic.
          Keeps each "active" arc per account (max 2 simultaneously), and what
          episode each arc is on.
