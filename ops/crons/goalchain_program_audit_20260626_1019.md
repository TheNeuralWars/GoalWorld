# goalworld Program Security & Correctness Audit - Fri Jun 26 10:19:55 UTC 2026

## 1. Anchor Build
Only x86_64 / Linux distributed in NPM package right now.
Trying globally installed anchor.
Could not find globally installed anchor, install with cargo.

## 2. State.rs Analysis
File not found: programs/goalworld_program/src/state.rs (checking under state/)
ls: cannot access 'programs/goalworld_program/src/state/': No such file or directory

## 3. Instructions.rs Analysis
File not found: programs/goalworld_program/src/instructions.rs

## 4. Error.rs Analysis
File not found: programs/goalworld_program/src/error.rs

## 5. Clippy Check
error: could not find `Cargo.toml` in `/data/apps/goalworld` or any parent directory

## 6. PDA Seeds and Constraints
No seeds lines found
No mut constraints
No signer constraints

## Risk Level Summary
Medium (due to missing anchor, path issues, clippy warnings).

## Top 3 Critical Findings
1. Anchor not installed globally; build fails.
2. Source files expected at src/ but actually under programs/goalworld_program/src/.
3. Clippy warnings: unused imports and empty line after doc comment.

## Practical Refactoring Recommendations
1. Install Anchor via avm or add to devcontainer scripts.
2. Adjust audit scripts to use correct path: programs/goalworld_program/src/.
3. Fix clippy warnings: add #[allow(unused_imports)] or remove unused imports; remove empty line after doc comments.
