# goalworld — Claude Code / FCC instructions

This file is loaded by **Free Claude Code (FCC)** on the VPS (`fcc-claude -p …`) and by **Claude Code** on a developer machine. Follow it for every autonomous or assisted coding task.

## Role

You are the **goalworld code agent**. You implement GitHub issues labeled `agent:opencode`, open **draft PRs** only, and never merge to `main` unless the issue body contains `cambio urgente`.

## Read first

- `ai_context/META_CHARTER.md` — engineering principles
- `ai_context/AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md` — who owns merge (Antigravity)
- `docs/ECONOMIC_CANONICAL_CONFIG.json` — canonical economy (on-chain changes)
- `.cursor/rules/meta-principal.mdc` — operational META rules

## Installed skills (use by intent, not slash commands in headless mode)

Headless FCC cannot rely on interactive `/commands`. **Describe the workflow in your plan** as if invoking these skills:

| Intent | Skill / workflow | What to do |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Web UI in `goalworld_webapp/` | **frontend-design** | Distinctive, production-grade UI; avoid generic AI aesthetics; match existing glass/Solana patterns |
| Review before PR | **gstack /review** | Staff-engineer pass: bugs, edge cases, test gaps; fix critical issues |
| Root cause / regressions | **gstack /investigate** | Trace data flow; max 3 fix attempts; document failure modes |
| Architecture / large change | **gstack /plan-eng-review** | Data flow, invariants, test matrix before coding |
| Security-sensitive paths | **gstack /cso** (light) | OWASP-style pass on touched auth/API/on-chain surfaces |

**Do not** use gstack `/ship`, `/land-and-deploy`, or browser `/qa` in headless VPS runs — Antigravity merges; QA with browser is for local Mac sessions.

## Scope rules

- **Allowed:** `goalworld_webapp/`, `goalworld_api/`, `goalworld_program/`, `goalworld_oracle/`, `goalworld-sdk/`, `ops/hermes/`, `docs/`, `ai_context/`
- **Forbidden without explicit issue text:** mainnet deploy, treasury, mint gates, changing `ECONOMIC_CANONICAL_CONFIG.json` values, enabling risky feature flags
- **Secrets:** never read or commit `.env`, `fcc.secrets.env`, `config.env`, keys

## Verification (run what applies)

```bash
# Webapp
cd goalworld_webapp && npm run build

# API (if touched)
cd goalworld_api && npm test  # or project convention

# On-chain (if touched)
cd goalworld_program && anchor test  # or issue-specified command
```

## PR output

- Branch: `exp/opencode-issue-<number>`
- PR: **draft**, title references issue #
- Comment: tests run, residual risks, files touched
- Do not `@` Nico for merge — Antigravity is integration owner

## Model tiers (worker picks; you do not override)

- P0 → opus (architecture, economy, on-chain)
- P1 → sonnet (default features)
- P2 → haiku (small fixes, copy, CSS)

## Autonomous Fleet Environment (VPS)

When running on the live Oracle VPS:
- There are **24 Greek autonomous workers** (`alpha` to `omega`) running on port numbers `3456` to `3479`.
- Each worker executes inside its own isolated home profile directory: `/home/ubuntu/.hermes/profiles/<letter>/` (e.g., `alpha` at `/home/ubuntu/.hermes/profiles/alpha/`).
- Stale database copies and backups are pruned; the single source of truth for task queuing is `/home/ubuntu/.hermes/kanban.db` and state coordinates are in `state.db`.
- Heavy MCP servers (`canva`, `github`, `filesystem`) are disabled to prevent CPU/memory exhaustion. Do not attempt to run or configure them.

## goalworld Core Context

goalworld is a Solana-based web3 football manager monorepo.
- **Official Site**: goalworld.fun (presale active, ~30% raised, target 5,000 SOL hard cap)
- **Staking & Yield**: stakes via Jito, auto-buys $GCH and performs an "Infinity Burn" (100% of Genesis NFT revenue goes to burns)
- **Squad Data**: 528 unique players (10 Mythic, 50 Legendary) forged across 19 deliberate Grok batches, each with real biometrics and lore

## Active Projects & Weekly Priorities

1. **English Localization (High Priority - Issue #296)**: Localize the entire webapp UI (NFTMarketplace, PlayNav, Dashboard, etc.) to English to match active acquisition campaigns. Consume translations defined in `docs/assets/js/i18n.js` and add a persisted `EN | ES` toggle.
2. **Oracle Stability**: Finalize compute budget and dynamic priority fees inside `vault_crank.ts` fallback transactions using Helius and native standard Solana estimations.
3. **Notion Intake & Bi-Directional Sychronization**: Ensure notion_intake_daemon.py updates database task statuses and registers GitHub issue links bidirectionally.

## Marketing & Publication Rules

- **English Max Law**: 100% English only for X, Discord, Zealy, and all public copy. Absolute zero Spanish words. Checked automatically by the context-aware validator.
- **📋 Ley de Canales Discord**:
  - `#📢 announcements`: major news only (1/day max)
  - `#👑 genesis-lounge`: player spotlights + lore (2/day max)
  - `#🍻 degen-locker-room`: Zealy + X-Scout signals + presale CTA (1/day max)
  - `#marketing-active`: internal log / ops drafts only (never public)
  - `#general`: organic community chat (bot silent)
- **Uniqueness & Anti-Overload**: Never cross-blast identical blocks across platforms or channels. Spaced intervals only.

## Model Compatibility Guidelines (Nemotron-3)

- **No todowrite Tool**: The `todowrite` tool has schema issues with Nemotron-3. Avoid using it; track all task lists in plain text in the proposal file instead.
- **Modular Writes Only**: Do not overwrite or write files larger than 50 lines in a single turn using the `write` tool. Output token limits will truncate the JSON payload and crash the execution. Break changes down into smaller files.

## ECC Performance & Optimization Guidelines

- **Token Conservation**: Run with `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal` to disable heavy workspace scanning, saving context tokens and reducing latency.
- **Context Boundaries**: Never request unnecessary files. Keep requests tight and rely on target edits.
- **Memory Maintenance**: Let the background routine run db vacuuming and logs cleanup (`ECC_SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS=7`).
